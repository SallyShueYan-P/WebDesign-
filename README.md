# WebDesign-
A small website has been designed and developed for a client, incorporating meticulous project planning to ensure a successful outcome. The provided text content from the client has been carefully edited and refined to align with the website's purpose. Attention has been given to information architecture, determining the placement of content across different pages to effectively achieve the site's goals.

The project involved improving the existing AutoKing Car Repairs website by implementing responsive design principles, conducting usability testing, and adding web form functionalities using JavaScript for user data validation. The website has been developed from scratch, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a tailored and seamless online platform.

By applying responsive design techniques, the website now offers a consistent and optimal user experience across various devices. The integration of JavaScript has enhanced the functionality of web forms, ensuring accurate and reliable data input. This comprehensive solution meets the client's specific requirements, reflecting their branding and catering to their target audience.
